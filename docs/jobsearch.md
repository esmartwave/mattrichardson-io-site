# The Interview Process

The four things that can have a big impact on your first impression are;
Punctuality – Arrive early and be ready to start
Positivity and enthusiasm – Bring your energy and your passion to the interview
Body language – Statistically, a large amount of a first impression is based on your body language and how you conduct yourself. Use this to your advantage, nodding and acknowledging is a simple way to show interest and that you’re listening.  
Be authentic – Be you! The interviewer wants to meet the real you, not who you think they want to meet.
Clarity – Be clear and concise with your communication. Try to provide succinct and compelling evidence of your skills and accomplishments.

Video interview – Do you have a quiet spot to complete the interview? Is there enough lighting? Beware of back lighting as the interviewer might not be able to see you clearly. Have you tested the internet connection? Have you considered the background the interviewer will see? Can you avoid distractions for the duration of the interview? What are you going to wear?
Face to face – What’s the appropriate dress code? Have you planned your journey? Have you reviewed either public transport or where you are going to park? Have you got something to make notes on? Do you have a drink to take in with you? Remember to be polite and friendly with everyone you meet – we’ve heard examples where the receptionist has been asked who they preferred!
Technical test – Have you allocated enough time to complete this? Have you found somewhere to complete this where you won’t be distracted? Most technical tests cannot be re-started so be clear that you can invest the time required.
